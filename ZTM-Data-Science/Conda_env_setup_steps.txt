5) conda activate <Folder Path>\env
6) conda install <package name> to install new packages to the current active environment.
7) Add 'env/' to .gitignore.
8) To make an environment.yml file, conda env export > environment.yml. (Note that this can be done only when the environment you want to export is activated).

-- type cls to clear screen in Anaconda Prompt.
-- conda env list. (To see list of all conda environments in the system)
-- conda list (shows installed libraries and their versions in the activated environment).
-- conda update 'package-name' (to update specific package to its latest version in the activated environment (please note that this package may not be the latest overall but it will be the latest of packages available in the anaconda ecosystem)).
-- conda list 'package-name' (to check version of specific package in the active environment).
-- conda search 'package-name' (To see if a specific package is available for installation).
